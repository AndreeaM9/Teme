        <ul>
          <li>Sigmund Freud (06.05.1856 â€“ 23.09.1939) was an Austrian neurologist, founder of psychoanalysis.</li>
          <li>In 1873, Freud graduated from the Sperl Gymnasium and, apparently inspired by the public reading of an essay by Goethe on nature, chose to pursue a medical career.
</li>
          <li>At the end of 1885, Freud left Vienna to continue his studies in neuropathology in Paris, where he worked under the guidance of Jean Martin Charcot.
 </li>
          <li> Although Freud would soon renounce his belief in hypnosis, in February 1886 he returned to Vienna with the seeds of his revolutionary method of practicing psychology in mind.
</li>
          <li>Freud had started to give private consultations in neuropsychology, and the office he opened on Berggasse no. 19 would remain the place where he would receive his patients for almost half a century.
</li>
        </ul>
